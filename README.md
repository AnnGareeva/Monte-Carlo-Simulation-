Monte­‐Carlo  Simulation   
Generate  distribution  of  0.01  quantile  (1%  percentile)  of  10-­‐days  overlapping   proportional  returns  obtained  from  the  3-­‐years  timeseries  (750  observations)  of   1-­‐day  returns.  Original  timeseries  is  generated  using  stable  distribution  with  the   following  parameters:  alpha  =  1.7;  beta  =  0.0;  gamma  =  1.0;  delta  =  1.0.   Show,  either  numerically  or  theoretically,  that  the  chosen  number  of  Monte-­‐ Carlo  trials  is  sufficient.  
Requirements:   Program  code  should  be  clearly  written  and  well   commented.   Code  must  be  presented  along  with  report  comprising  all  necessary   mathematical  expressions,  description  of  results  and  conclusions.  
Hint:   1-­‐day  returns:   r1 = Pi+1 − Pii P  ,  i=1…751   i and  Pi  is  price  at  i-­‐th  day.   n-­‐days  returns:   rni = Pi+n − Pi P   i
